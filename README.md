**🧨 Create Various Types of Bombs:**  

- **⏰ Timed** – set the timer, plant the device, and walk away. Countdown… BOOM.  
- **🎮 Remote (Hz frequency)** – sync multiple bombs on the same frequency and detonate them simultaneously.  
- **📱 Phone Triggered** – configure a phone number and call it to trigger the explosion.  
- **🚗 Speed Bomb** – installed in a vehicle, detonates upon reaching a set speed.



**🧪 Dangerous Materials**  
You can configure **which items in the game are explosive materials**—just add them to the list and transporting them becomes risky business. If a player drives with such an item and crashes, there’s a **chance it will explode**.



**🔥 Any Material = Any Bomb**  
Each material—whether it’s **C4**, **thermite**, a **watch**, a **controller chip**, a **hacked phone**, or even a **speedometer**—can be used to create bombs with **unique properties**.

💥 **This is the core strength of the system:**  
For **each material, you can assign a custom explosion type**, so:

- **C4** can have a powerful classic explosion with a strong shockwave  
- **Thermite** can create a fiery blast without noise but massive burning effects  
- **SmokeChip** may only generate a dense smoke cloud perfect for distraction  

Every material has its own style—and you decide what it does!



**💀 Realistic Blast Radius and Impact**  
Every explosion includes:

- ⚫ **Kill radius (instant death zone)**  
- 🟠 **Damage radius (area of injury)**  
- 🔵 **Shockwave** that realistically knocks down and pushes characters around

The effects are natural, spectacular, and fully configurable—making **each explosion unique and immersive**.



**🧨 Custom Explosions**  
With **CustomExplosion** functionality, you can assign each material.

This allows you to build an entire arsenal of explosives—from small door charges to massive territory bombs—each with its own behavior.



**🛠️ UI and Minigames**  
Bomb creation, planting, and defusing all happen through a **dedicated, intuitive UI** with interactive **minigames** that build tension and give players the feeling of “working” on the bomb.

🧰 **Crafting** – select material, components, set properties, and complete the assembly minigame  
📦 **Planting** – pick the spot, configure settings, and complete the planting sequence  
💣 **Defusing** – reflexes and timing matter in this high-pressure minigame—one mistake means boom!  
🎛️ **Configuration** – adjust frequency, phone number, timer, or speed activation with a slick interface



**⚙️ Full Customization & Flexibility**  
- 🔩 Choose which items become explosive materials  
- 🔁 Set the chance of explosion on collisions  
- 💥 Define explosion types and power for each material  
- 🌪️ Enable shockwaves and configure their radius  
- 🔧 Create custom explosion styles (smoke, fire, EMP, etc.)

- 🚙 Customize vehicle bombs with km/h or mph speed triggers



**🎯 Who Is This For?**
